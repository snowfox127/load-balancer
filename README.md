# Equiload

## Overview

This project implements a basic load balancer in Python, ensuring that incoming network traffic is distributed across multiple servers to optimize resource utilization, improve performance, and enhance reliability.

## Features

- **Round-Robin Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming requests evenly across a set of backend servers.
- **Health Checks**: Periodically checks the health of backend servers and excludes any that are unresponsive.
